# Text Analysis Tool

This is a text program that has many features for manipulating the text of a book! 

The main parts of this program are the ability to remove "stop words" (words like a, the, am, etc.). Not only that, but this program will also remove all punctuation and set every word to lowercase. 

# What it Does

The main use of this program is to take in a text file (such as a book) and manipulate the text in said file. It is able to do this in a few ways. These include:
- Removing punctuation from the entire text
- Removing capitalization from the entire text
- Removing stop words from the desired text file
- Output n-grams of text file

# What I Learned

One of the biggest things I learned throughout the duration of this project was how to combine multiple classes and functions to all work together. It was a challenge to find the right place to put the calls to each helper function or class, but eventually I figured out where the appropriate places were. 

I also learned how to efficently problem-solve when an error would stop all progress on my code. I learned it is efficent to output mutliple test lines, to see where the program stops working, or if it outputs something an incorrect amount of times. 

Lastly, and arguably most importantly, I learned about how to manipulate strings. I believe that string manipulation is an important thing to know, and this program taught me how to do it efficiently and effectively. 

Overall, it was a very fun program and I learned a lot!!
